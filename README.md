## Introduction to Problem or Opportunity
Music is all around us and plays a key part in today’s culture. Popularity in music is always hard to determine. It is unpredictable determining which song is going to be a hit. Music popularity also plays a crucial role in establishing if the song is going to be a Grammy award winner. There are different perspectives we need to take into consideration such as how music taste changes during a pandemic, or how seasonality affects it. We will look at the popularity of music based on the song’s attributes.

## Research Question
Given the past 20 years of data, we want to determine what effect song attributes (Danceability, Energy, Tempo, etc.) have on the popularity of a song that has been obtained from the US population. Can the song attributes predict whether it will be a Grammy award winner?

## Data Resources
We have obtained the dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains song attributes, popularity, Grammy award-winning songs, and other aspects.
